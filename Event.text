     What is an Event?
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when 
the user or the browser manipulates a page.
When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that 
click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, 
closing a window, resizing a window, etc.
Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript coded responses, which 
cause buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, data to be 
validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.
Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 and every HTML 
element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code.
Please go through this small tutorial for a better understanding HTML Event 
Reference. Here we will see a few examples to understand the relation between 
Event and JavaScript.
